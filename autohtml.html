                    <H4 class="textfile">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain following parts:
* Text content (what you see)
* Markup (what it looks like)
* Reference to other documents
* Links to other pages

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. The relationship between elements is like family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

                    <H4 class="textfile">Avoiding Errors: When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
Consistency: In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetition, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

Computers are different. A computer can be programmed to do anything we want, as long as we can write a program that specifies a specific sequence of instructions.

                    <H4 class="textfile">Just like human languages have grammars, programming languages do too. A grammar is a specification of what is "correct" and what is "incorrect."
In languages like English, people can ofent make sense of sentences that aren't technically "correct," but computers aren't smart enough to do this. This means we have to write code that is exactly "correct" according to the Python interpreter, otherwise our code won't run.

                    <H4 class="textfile">There are five debugging strategies introduced: 1) Examine error messages when programs crash. The last line of Python Tracebacks will tell you what went wrong. Reading backwards from there will tell you more about where the problem occurred.
2) Work from example code. If your modified code doesn't work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example code until it does what you want. 
3) Make sure examples work. Just because you find example code doesn't mean it will work in your system. Check the example code you're using to make sure it behaves the way you expect.
4) Check (print) intermediate results. When your code doesn't crash, but doesn't behave as expected, add print statements to your program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.
5) Keep and compare old versions. When you have a working version of your code, save it before you add to the code. This will give you something to go back to if you introduce too many new bugs.

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">Mutation means changing the value of an object. Lists support mutation. This is the second main difference between strings and lists.

                    <H3 class="subtitle"> Alias

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">It is called aliasing when there are two names that refer to the same object. Aliasing is very useful, but also can be very confusing since one mutation can impact many variables. If something happens that changes the state of the object, it affects the state of the object for all names that refer to that object.

                    <H3 class="subtitle"> Strings are Immutable

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">Note that we cannot mutate strings, since they are immutable objects. Try mutating a string in the interpreter: #!highlight python s = 'Hello' s[0] = 'Y' 'str' object does not support item assignment.

                    <H3 class="subtitle"> Mutable and Immutable Objects

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">The key difference between mutable and immutable objects, is that once an object is mutable, you have to worry about other variables that might refer to the same object. You can change the value of that object and it affects not just variable you think you changed, but other variables that refer to the same object as well.

                    <H3 class="subtitle"> List Operations

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">There are many built-in operations on lists. Here are a few of the most useful ones here: 1) Append - The append method adds a new element to the end of a list. The append method mutates the list that it is invoked on, it does not create a new list. The syntax for the append method is: (''list'').append((''element''))
2) Concatenation - The + operator can be used with lists and is very similar to how it is used to concatenate strings. It produces a new list, it does not mutate either of the input lists. (''list'') + (''list'') 
3) Length - The len operator can be used to find out the length of an object. The len operator works for many things other than lists, it works for any object that is a collection of things including strings. The output from len is the number of elements in its input.

                    <H3 class="subtitle"> For Loops

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">In Python there is a more convenient way to loop through the elements of a list: the for loop. The syntax looks like this: for (''name'') in (''list''): (''block''). The loop goes through each element of the list in turn, assigning that element to the (name) and evaluating the (block).

                    </H4>
                    <H3 class="subtitle"> Index

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">There are many other ways to define find_element. A built-in list operation that we have not yet introduced that makes it easier to write find_element is the index method: (''list'').index((''value'')) to give (''position'') or error 
The index method is invoked on a list by passing in a value, and the output is the first position where that value sits in the list. If the list that does not contain any occurrences of the value you pass in, index produces an error (this is different from the find method for strings which we used in Unit 1, that returns a -1 when the target string is not found).

                    </H4>
                    <H3 class="subtitle"> In

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">Test if the element is anywhere in the list. We have already seen in used in the for loop, however outside of a for loop header it means something different: (''value'') in (''list'') -) (''Boolean''). The output is True if the list contains an element matching value, and False if it does not.

                    </H4>
                    <H3 class="subtitle"> Not In

                    </H3>
                    <H4 class="textfile">Similarly, you can use not in, which has the opposite meaning of in: (''value'') not in (''list''). If the value is not in the list the result of (value) not in (list) is True, and if the (value) is in the (list) than the result is False.
